                <p class="short-paragraph"> When developing this website we ran accessibility tests for all the different pages multiple times
                    and made changes along with the results. This image shows an accessibility test for one of our pages. The test was done with 
                    Lighthouse, a built in developer tool for chrome. Eventually we got a near <strong>100 score</strong> on each of the parameters of
                    the test. </p>

                <h1>Semantics</h1>
                <p class="long-paragraph">One of the tools we used to achive accessibility for our pages was to follow the guidelines from
                    websites such as W3schools.com and MDN Web Docs. They specified the importance of semantics and the correct use of 
                    html tags. This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">page on HTML Elements from MDN</a> has a list of different elements and their usecases, which we followed to make 
                    sure we had the correct tags in our own pages. For example, on this page, which layout is shared by all our pages except Topical, 
                    we have a large image at the top of the page, and then the main content further down. Therefore the html code structuring the elements 
                    such as the big image, navigation bar and primary header are put inside a &lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt; while the elements
                    below are all put in a &lt;main&gt; &lt;/main&gt;. Within main our elements are supposed to come in pairs of some text and a 
                    image. These pairs are grouped by &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; and further grouped by another section for the text
                    and a &lt;picture&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; to contain the image and image text. We belive this is a nice structured way to 
                    order the different elements and sections, both visually for the user and semantically for the browser and a potential
                    future developer. </p>

                <h1>Design choices</h1>
                <p class="short-paragraph">When designing these pages we wanted a simplistic and clear design that makes it accessible to all. For example, 
                    all text is carefully written so it is both concise and easy to understand. Additionally it should also be easy to read, so we made sure all text stands
                    in contrast to its background while also having a decently large font. As we worked on this project we did not just rely on automated tests 
                    like Lighthouse to ensure accessibility, we also took advice from guides like this <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/profile/web/accessibility/checklist-for-universal-design-on-uio.html">checklist for universal design from UIO</a>  </p>

                <h1>Scalability</h1>
                <p class="short-paragraph">Another feature we had in mind when developing this project was the ability to scale the pages when further developing. In the
                    design we used for the introduction page, extra page and this page we have the content in the main part grouped in blocks of one image and a paragraph. If
                    we or a future developer wanted to add another section or paragraph it would be as simple as adding another block. In the picture of the code for the extra page 
                    we see that we have three blocks following this pattern of a paragraph accompanied by a picture.   </p>
